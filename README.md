Custom wordpress starter theme with a simple framework

This theme has been developed over the years from various frameworks etc that have shaped my own workflow.

The aim is to create a started theme that gives you flexiblity from the start, but allows you to develop quickly and with ease of understanding.

The theme is a combination of:
 - Twitter bootstrap (sass)
 - HTML5 Boilerplate 4.3
 - Grunt to compile/livereload/etc

Wordpress inspiration from:
 - Roots theme
 - Genesis framework
 - Wordpress core themes
